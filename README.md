## Introduction

The apple farming industry faces significant challenges related to the timely detection and management of foliar diseases, which can have detrimental effects on crop yields and quality. The primary objective of our project is to address this concern by creating an automated and accurate Apple Foliar Disease Detector (AFD) that leverages the power of Digital Image Processing.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Develop a state-of-the-art AFD system.
- **Key Features**:
  - Image preprocessing for optimal analysis.
  - Disease classification powered by machine learning algorithms.
  - Intuitive and user-friendly web-based interface.
  - Support for both real-time and batch processing.
- **Expected Outcomes**: A fully functional and impactful AFD system for early disease detection in apple orchards.

## Operational Workflow

The AFD system follows a structured operational workflow:

1. Image Preprocessing: Enhancements are applied to leaf images for noise reduction and feature enhancement.
2. Disease Classification: Machine learning models perform leaf classification, distinguishing between healthy and diseased states.
3. User Interface: An intuitive web interface allows users to interact with the system.
4. Real-time or Batch Processing: The system accommodates both real-time and batch processing modes for leaf images.

## Dataset Utilization

We have leveraged a comprehensive dataset comprising labeled apple tree leaf images for the training and evaluation of our AFD system. The dataset includes a variety of foliar diseases, ensuring the system's robustness.

## License

This project is distributed under the [MIT License](LICENSE), granting you the freedom to employ or adapt the code for educational or project-specific purpose.

## Conclusion
We trust that our AFD system will significantly contribute to the early detection and management of foliar diseases within apple orchards.
